\section{Introduction}
Elliptic partial differential equations can be solved by using finite difference equations,
and the most common FDE for the solution of an elliptic PDE is obtained by second-order
central difference approximations of the derivatives. Afterwards, the FDE can
be solved either by direct solution methods or iterative methods. In this homework, a 2D
heat equation is given:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2T}{\partial y^2} = 0
	\label{eqn:heateqn}
\end{equation}

It is requested to compute the steady state temperature distribution on a given 2D model
of a room having a width of 10m and a height of 6m by solving the above equation for 
two different cases, one is with a radiator and the other is without a radiator. First,
the iterative methods are used; Point Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR and Line Gauss-Seidel
methods, then the solution is obtained by the direct solution methods. For the final
solution, it is asked to plot the heat flux distribution in the room, and the heat flux
vector is given as follows:

\begin{equation}
	\vec{q} = -k \nabla T
	\label{eqn:heatflux}
\end{equation}

It is also asked to compare the convergence rates of the iterative methods.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Solution of the Heat Equation in the Absence of a Radiator}
Figures \ref{fig:pointnorad}, \ref{fig:gaussnorad}, and \ref{fig:sornorad}
illustrates the solution of the heat equation by using Point Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel,
and SOR methods, respectively. As can be seen from these figures, all the solutions
with different methods converged to approximately the same heat flux distributions.
In all solutions, flux vectors have the same directions, which are from the walls
with higher temperature to the wall with the lower temperature perpendicularly.
Moreover, near the insulated wall, these flux vectors are parallel and the temperature
contours are perpendicular to the wall since the temperature gradient is zero at the
insulated wall. Therefore, there is no heat transfer across the insulated wall.

\subsubsection{Temperature Distributions along x=5m and y=3m}
Figures \ref{fig:x5norad} and \ref{fig:y3norad} shows the temperature distributions along
x=5 and y=3 lines respectively. It can be oberved that all methods gave the same result with
a negligible difference among them although their convergence rates differ.

\subsection{Comparison of the Convergence Rates}
Figures \ref{fig:convnorad} and \ref{fig:convrad} demonstrate the convergence rates of Point
Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and SOR methods for the solutions of the heat equation without and with
the radiator, respectively. As can be observed from these figure, the responses of Point Jacobi
method are the slowest. On the other hand, Gauss-Seidel method converges faster for both.
This is because it uses newly computed values of the unknowns as they become available as 
mentioned in Subsection ?. Furthermore, SOR method computed the solutions with minimum number
of iterations which is a result of the use of the relaxation parameter. This is also mentioned
in Subsection ?. The relaxation parameter is taken 1.9 for both since this is its largest
possible value which is found experimentally. For higher relaxation parameter values, the
solutions did not converge.
