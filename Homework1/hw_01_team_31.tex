\section{Introduction}

It is useful to use numerical methods in order to solve differential equations when
the analytical solution is time consuming. In this homework, we are given an aircraft
which rolls on the ground and takes off some time later, and we are asked to find
the minimum time required for this aircraft to take off at different airport altitudes.
We know that the aircraft will take off when the lift force is higher than the weight of
the aircraft. Since the lift force is a function of velocity;

\begin{equation}
        L = C_L \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho_{\infty} \cdot V_{\infty}^{2} \cdot S
\end{equation}

first we should calculate velocity which is described in a differential form for
this problem using the force balance equation in the horizontal direction:

\begin{equation}
        \frac{W}{g} \cdot \frac{dV}{dt} = T - D - \mu \cdot (W - L)
\end{equation}

where the lift and drag forces are initially zero. The next values of drag force is calculated
by this formula:

\begin{equation}
        D = C_D \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho_{\infty} \cdot V_{\infty}^{2} \cdot S
\end{equation}

Therefore we are asked to use Euler's and RK2 methods so that we can approach the
solution with the help of numerical methods.


\section{Method}
Euler's method can be defined as the first order Taylor Series Expansion. In this method, the space between
the initial point of the independent variable and the desired next point is divided into discrete points. The 
difference between respective discrete points is named as step size, $\Delta x$. Then, a first order ordinary
differential equation at initial point, is calculated and treated as slope.
\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dx} \equiv y \prime \equiv f(x,y) \equiv SLOPE
\end{equation}
The slope is multiplied by the stepsize
and added to initial dependent variable. The result gave the next dependent variable.

\begin{center}
Next Value = Previous Value + Step Size $\times $ Slope
\end{center}
\begin{equation}
y(x + \Delta x ) = y(x) + \Delta x f(x,y)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
y_{i+1} = y_i + \Delta x f(x_i , y_i)
\label{eq:eul}
\end{equation}
This equation was repeated until the $x_i$ exceeded the desired independent point.

Second Order Runge-Kutta method has the similar equation form with Euler's method:
\begin{equation}
y_{i+1} = y_i + \Delta x \phi (x_i , y_i, \Delta x)
\label{eq:rk2}
\end{equation}
However, in second order RK method, $y\prime $ is not used as slope. In stead of $y\prime $, $\phi$ which is 
called increment function is used. $\phi$ is weighted slope function over the interval.
\begin{eqnarray}
\phi&=&a_1k_1 + a_2k_2\\
\frac{dy}{dx}&=&f(x,y) \nonumber\\
k_1&=&f(x_i,y_i) \nonumber\\
k_2&=&f(x_i+p_i\Delta x, y_i+p_i\Delta x k_1) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $p_i<1$  and
We chose $p_i = 2/3 $.
\begin{eqnarray}
a_1+a_2 = 1  \nonumber \\
a_2p_1 = \frac{1}{2} \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
Therefore, $a_1=1/4$ and $a_2=3/4$ .
Trapezoidal integration rule is basic version of calculating area under a curve. It is based on
dividing the area under the curve $y(x)$ into small trapezoids. Then, areas of trapezoids which was equal to 
$\frac {1}{2}(V_i+V_{i+1})\Delta t $ is summed up:
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{N_p\Delta t} V(t) dt = \sum_{i=0}^{N_p-1} \frac{1}{2}(V_i+V_{i+1}) \Delta t 
\end{equation}

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Calculation of velocity at sea level with Euler's Method }
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering \includegraphics[max height=10cm]{graphs/question1.eps}
\caption{Calculation of velocity using Euler's Method with three different time steps at sea level.}
     \label{fig:q1}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:q1}, by using different time step sizes we obtain different results.
Initially, the results were approximately the same for all time step sizes but as time progresses, the margin of error increases.
This increase occurs at different rates for each time step size. In order to illustrate, when $ \Delta t = 3 $, the
error grows faster than other cases. If we assume that we have the least error when $ \Delta t = 0.5 $, since it is
the smallest time step among all, we can observe that the curves of the other steps deviates more as the time step gets
higher. Thus, when $ \Delta t = 3 $, the result is the least accurate.

\begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering \includegraphics[max height=10cm]{graphs/question1_finaltime.eps}
        \caption{Detailed version of Figure \ref{fig:q1} focused on the endpoints.}
        \label{fig:q1_closer}
\end{figure}

 The effects of using different time step sizes on the result can be clearly seen in Figure \ref{fig:q1_closer}.
 In the first problem of the homework, we were asked to find the minimum time needed for the given aircraft to
 lift off at sea level. When we take a closer look at the curves as we did in Figure \ref{fig:q1_closer}, the
 end points, which gives the lift off time and velocity, are different from each other, and as we mentioned 
 before, we approach the result more precisely for $ \Delta t = 0.5 $. That means, if we want to obtain more precise result, 
 we must decrease the step size.
\newpage
\subsection{Calculation of velocity at different altitudes with Euler's Method }
\begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering \includegraphics[max height=10cm]{graphs/altitude.eps}
        \caption{Calculated velocities at different altitudes using Euler's method with $\Delta t = 0.5$.}
        \label{fig:altitude}
\end{figure}

It can be obtained from Figure \ref{fig:altitude} that it takes longer for the given aircraft to take off at higher altitudes. 
This is because as the altitude gets higher, the air density decreases, which results in lower maximum available
thrust. In addition to that, lift and drag forces also decreases since they are functions of the free stream
air density. The decrease in drag should normally result in shorter take off time while the decrease in thrust and lift force acts exactly the opposite way. However, 
the effect of both the lift force and the thrust overcomes the effect of the drag force. Therefore, take off time increases at higher altitudes.
