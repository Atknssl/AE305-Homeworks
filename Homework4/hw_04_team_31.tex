\section{Introduction}
Finite Difference Method uses finite-difference relations which are obtained from Taylor
series expansions in order to approximate the partial derivatives in a partial differential
equation. The equations representing the partial differentials are called Finite Difference
Equations. In this homework, given a convection-diffusion wave equation:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial t} + V\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial x} = \nu\frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial x^2}
	\label{eqn:gaussian}
\end{equation}

where V is the constant convection velocity, $\nu$ is the diffusion (viscosity) coefficient,
and $\omega$ is distributed initially as follows:
\begin{equation}
	\omega(x,t=0) = exp(-b ln2(x/\Delta x)^2)
\end{equation}

where $\Delta x = 0.1$, and $b = 0.025$, it is requested to solve Equation \ref{eqn:gaussian} by modifying the given fortran code and
using forward-time central-space FDE, and prove that the equation is conditionally stable by
using different $\sigma$ (Courant number) and d values where $\sigma$ and d values are as the following:

\begin{eqnarray}
	\sigma &=& \frac{V\Delta t}{\Delta x} \nonumber \\
	d &=& \frac{\nu\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}
\end{eqnarray}
It is also asked to solve both Equation \ref{eqn:gaussian} and convection equation, where d equals
zero, by forward-time backward-space FDE and compare the solutions. Afterwards, given a high order
accuracy FDE, first, it is requested to perform consistency analysis on it and then solving
Equation \ref{eqn:gaussian} by using this FDE:

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{-\omega^{n+1}_{i}+4\omega^{n}_{i}-3\omega^{n-1}_{i}}{2\Delta t} + V\frac{\omega^{n}_{i+1}-\omega^{n}_{i-1}}{2\Delta x} = \nu\frac{\omega^{n}_{i+1}-2\omega^{n}_{i}+\omega^{n}_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2}
\end{eqnarray}

Finally, implicit FDE (backward-time central-space) is used to solve Equation \ref{eqn:gaussian}.
In all solutions the range of x is such that -L/2$\leq$x$\leq$L/2 where L=40.

\section{Method}
\subsection{Finite Difference Method}
Finite Difference method is used to solve partial differential equations by 
approximating partial derivatives in these equations with finite difference relations.
In this homework, 1-D, linear, convection-diffusion equation and convection equation are solved
with a combination of finite difference approximations.
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} + V\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}=\nu\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}
	\label{eqn:cde}
\end{equation}
is convective diffusion equation and
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} + V\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}=0 
	\label{eqn:ce}
\end{equation}
is convective equation.\\
Two different derivations are used for the explicit finite difference equation of 
Equation \ref{eqn:cde} in this homework.The first derivation of FDE is also used for the explicit 
FDE of Equation \ref{eqn:ce}. In both derivations, the first term of
the equation forward time approximation is used.
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial w}{\partial t}\vert^{n}=\frac{w^{n+1}-{w^n}}{\Delta t}+O(\Delta t)
	\label{eqn:ft}
\end{equation}
In the first derivation, for second and third terms of the Equation \ref{eqn:cde}, 
central space approximations of
$\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\vert_{i}$ of order ($\Delta x^2$) and 
$\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}\vert_{i}$ of order ($\Delta x^2$), respectively, are used.
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\vert_{i}=\frac{w_{i+1}-w_{i-1}}{2\Delta x}+O(\Delta x^2)
	\label{eqn:cs1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}\vert_{i}=\frac{w_{i+1}-2w_i+w_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2}+O(\Delta x^2)
	\label{eqn:cs2}
\end{equation}
By substituting Equation \ref{eqn:ft}, \ref{eqn:cs1}, and \ref{eqn:cs2} into Equation \ref{eqn:cde}, it becomes:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{w_{i}^{n+1}-{w_{i}^{n}}}{\Delta t}+\frac{w_{i+1}^{n}-w_{i-1}^{n}}{2\Delta x}
	=\frac{w_{i+1}^{n}-2w_{i}^{n}+w_{i-1}^{n}}{\Delta x^2}+O(\Delta x^2, \Delta t)
\end{equation}
The explicit FDE of Equation \ref{eqn:cde} based on forward time and central spatial differences (FTCS) is obtained:
\begin{equation}
	w_{i}^{n+1}= w_{i}^{n}-\frac{\sigma}{2}(w_{i+1}^{n}-w_{i-1}^{n})+d(w_{i+1}^{n}-2w_{i}^{n}+w_{i-1}^{n})+O(\Delta x^2,\Delta t)
	\label{eqn:FTCS}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma = \frac{V\Delta t}{\Delta x }$ and $d = \frac{\nu\Delta t}{\Delta x^2 }$.
\\To derive the explicit FDE of Equation \ref{eqn:ce}, Equation \ref{eqn:ft} and \ref{eqn:cs1} are
substituted into Equation \ref{eqn:ce}:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{w_{i}^{n+1}-{w_{i}^{n}}}{\Delta t}+\frac{w_{i+1}^{n}-w_{i-1}^{n}}{2\Delta x}
	=0+O(\Delta x^2, \Delta t)
\end{equation}
The explicit FDE of Equation \ref{eqn:ce} based on forward time and central spatial differences (FTCS) is obtained:
\begin{equation}
	w_{i}^{n+1}= w_{i}^{n}-\frac{\sigma}{2}w_{i+1}^{n}-w_{i-1}^{n}+O(\Delta x^2, \Delta t)
\end{equation}
where $\sigma = \frac{V\Delta t}{\Delta x }$.
\\In the second derivation, instead of central space approximation, backward space approximation is used.
Backward space approximation of $\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\vert$ of order ($\Delta x$):
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\vert_{i}=\frac{w_{i}-w_{i-1}}{\Delta x}+O(\Delta x)
	\label{eqn:bs1}
\end{equation}
Backward space approximation of $\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}\vert$ of order ($\Delta x$):
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}\vert_{i}=\frac{w_{i}-2w_{i-1}+w_{i-2}}{\Delta x^2}+O(\Delta x)
	\label{eqn:bs2}
\end{equation}
By substituting Equation \ref{eqn:ft}, \ref{eqn:bs1}, and \ref{eqn:bs2} into Equation \ref{eqn:cde}:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{w_{i}^{n+1}-{w_{i}^{n}}}{\Delta t}+\frac{w_{i}^{n}-w_{i-1}^{n}}{\Delta x}
	=\frac{w_{i}^{n}-2w_{i-1}^{n}+w_{i-2}^{n}}{\Delta x^2}+O(\Delta x,\Delta t)
\end{equation}
The explicit FDE of Equation \ref{eqn:cde} based on forward time and backward spatial
differences (FTBS) is obtained:
\begin{equation}
	w_{i}^{n+1}= w_{i}^{n}-\sigma(w_{i+1}^{n}-w_{i-1}^{n})+d(w_{i}^{n}-2w_{i-1}^{n}+w_{i-2}^{n})+O(\Delta x,\Delta t)
\end{equation}
where $\sigma = \frac{V\Delta t}{\Delta x }$ and $d = \frac{\nu\Delta t}{\Delta x^2 }$.
\\ To obtain the implicit FDE of Equation \ref{eqn:cde}, backward time central space method is used.
Backward time difference is used for the first term of Equation \ref{eqn:cde}:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial w}{\partial t}\vert^{n}=\frac{w^{n}-w^{n-1}}{\Delta x}+O(\Delta t)
	\label{eqn:bt}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eqn:cs1} and \ref{eqn:cs2} are used to approximate the second and third
terms of Equation \ref{eqn:cde}, respectively. Equation \ref{eqn:bt}, \ref{eqn:cs1}
and \ref{eqn:cs2} are inserted in the Equation \ref{eqn:cde}:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{w_{i}^{n}-{w_{i}^{n-1}}}{\Delta t}+\frac{w_{i+1}^{n-1}-w_{i-1}^{n-1}}{2\Delta x}
	=\frac{w_{i+1}^{n-1}-2w_{i}^{n-1}+w_{i-1}^{n-1}}{\Delta x^2}+O(\Delta x^2, \Delta t)
\end{equation}
To define a PDE as implicit, it should be discretized at time level $n+1$. So, equation becomes:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{w_{i}^{n+1}-{w_{i}^{n}}}{\Delta t}+\frac{w_{i+1}^{n+1}-w_{i-1}^{n+1}}{2\Delta x}
	=\frac{w_{i+1}^{n+1}-2w_{i}^{n+1}+w_{i-1}^{n+1}}{\Delta x^2}+O(\Delta x^2, \Delta t)	
\end{equation}
The implicit FDE of Equation \ref{eqn:cde} based on BTCS Euler Implicit method is obtained:
\begin{equation}
	-(\frac{\sigma}{2}+d)w_{i-1}^{n+1}+(2d+1)w_{i}^{n+1}+(\frac{\sigma}{2}-d)w_{i+1}^{n+1} = w_{i}^{n}
	\label{eqn:implicit}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma = \frac{V\Delta t}{\Delta x }$ and $d = \frac{\nu\Delta t}{\Delta x^2 }$.
\newpage
\subsection{Thomas Algorithm}
As a consequence of the usage of the BTCS Euler Implicit method to solve the convection-diffusion
equation, the tridiagonal system of equations is obtained. The general form of the tridiagonal system
equation with k unknowns:
\begin{equation}
	a_i x_{i-1}+b_i x_i+c_i x_{i+1}=f_i
\end{equation}
where $a_1$ and $c_k$ is not used.\\System of equations can be written as following form
\begin{equation}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		b_1 & c_1    & 0      &\dots    &0   \\
		a_2 & b_2    & c_2    &\dots    &\vdots\\
		0   & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots	& 0    \\
		\vdots& \dots&a_{k-1} & b_{k-1} & c_{k-1}\\
		0   & \dots  & 0      & a_k     & b_k 
		\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		x_1\\
		x_2\\
		\vdots\\
		x_{k-1}\\
		x_k
		\end{Bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		f_1\\
		f_2\\
		\vdots\\
		f_{k-1}\\
		f_k
	\end{Bmatrix}
	\label{eqn:matrx}
\end{equation}
The first term of Equation \ref{eqn:matrx} has 3 non-zero diagonals so
it is a tridiagonal matrix. Equation \ref{eqn:matrx} can be solved with Thomas
Algorihtm.

\subsection{Consistency Analysis of the Given FDE}
\label{sub:cons}
Consistency is one of the conditions to be able to approximate the PDE. What is meant by consistency is
that as the step sizes go to zero, FDE should converge to the PDE. For a given FDE written at a point
(i,n), consistency analysis is to expand the discrete values with Taylor series expansions and leaving
the original PDE terms on the left-hand-side and all the other terms on the right-hand side. If the right
hand side goes to zero as the step sizes go to zero, the FDE is consistent. This procedure is carried
out for the following FDE: 

\begin{equation}
	\frac{-\omega^{n+1}_{i}+4\omega^{n}_{i}-3\omega^{n-1}_{i}}{2\Delta t} + V\frac{\omega^{n}_{i+1}-\omega^{n}_{i-1}}{2\Delta x} = \nu\frac{\omega^{n}_{i+1}-2\omega^{n}_{i}+\omega^{n}_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2}
	\label{equation:q4}
\end{equation}

First, all terms except the $\omega^{n}_{i}$ term, are expanded aorund $\omega^{n}_{i}$ with TSE:

\begin{eqnarray}
	\omega^{n+1}_i &=& w^n_i + \Delta t \omega_t|^n_i + \frac{\Delta t^2}{2} \omega_{tt}|^n_i + \frac{\Delta t^3}{6} \omega_{ttt}|^n_i ... \nonumber \\
	\omega^{n-1}_i &=& w^n_i - \Delta t \omega_t|^n_i + \frac{\Delta t^2}{2} \omega_{tt}|^n_i - \frac{\Delta t^3}{6} \omega_{ttt}|^n_i ... \nonumber \\
	\omega^n_{i+1} &=& w^n_i + \Delta x \omega_x|^n_i + \frac{\Delta x^2}{2} \omega_{xx}|^n_i + \frac{\Delta x^3}{6} \omega_{xxx}|^n_i ... \nonumber \\
	\omega^n_{i-1} &=& w^n_i - \Delta x \omega_x|^n_i + \frac{\Delta x^2}{2} \omega_{xx}|^n_i - \frac{\Delta x^3}{6} \omega_{xxx}|^n_i ... 
\end{eqnarray}

Then the above relations are substituted into Equation \ref{equation:q4}:

\begin{equation}
	\omega_t|^n_i - \Delta t \omega_{tt}|^n_i + \frac{\Delta t^2}{6} \omega_{ttt}|^n_i + V\omega_x|^n_i + V\frac{\Delta x^2}{6}\omega_{xxx}|^n_i = \nu\omega_{xx}|^n_i + O(\Delta t^4,\Delta x^4)
\end{equation}

Collecting the original PDE terms to the RHS:

\begin{equation}
	[\omega_t + V\omega_x - \nu\omega_{xx}]|^n_i = \Delta t \omega_{tt}|^n_i - \frac{\Delta t^2}{6} \omega_{ttt}|^n_i - V\frac{\Delta x^2}{6}\omega_{xxx}|^n_i + O(\Delta t^4,\Delta x^4)
	\label{equation:consistency}
\end{equation}

Since the right-hand-side terms go to zero as $\Delta t$ and $\Delta x$ approach to zero, the FDE given
in Equation \ref{equation:q4} is consistent.

In order to understand the effect of the leading error term on the right-hand side the leading term's time
derivatives are converted to spatial derivatives using the Equation \ref{eqn:cde} as follows:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial t} = \nu\frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial x^2} - V\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial x}
\end{equation}

Differentiating with respect to time:

\begin{eqnarray}
	\frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial t^2} &=& \nu\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}(\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial t}) - V\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial t}) \nonumber \\
	\frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial t^2} &=& \nu\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}(\nu\frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial x^2} - V\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial x}) - V\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\nu\frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial x^2} - V\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial x}) \nonumber \\
	\frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial t^2} &=& \nu^2\frac{\partial^4 \omega}{\partial x^4} - 2V\nu\frac{\partial^3 \omega}{\partial x^3} + V^2\frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial x^2}
	\label{eqnarray:t2}
\end{eqnarray}

Differentiating the last equation one more time:

\begin{eqnarray}
	\frac{\partial^3 \omega}{\partial t^3} &=& \nu^2\frac{\partial^4}{\partial x^4}(\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial t}) - 2V\nu\frac{\partial^3}{\partial x^3}(\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial t}) + V^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}(\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial t}) \nonumber \\
	\frac{\partial^3 \omega}{\partial t^3} &=& \nu^2\frac{\partial^4}{\partial x^4}(\nu\frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial x^2} - V\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial x}) - 2V\nu\frac{\partial^3}{\partial x^3}(\nu\frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial x^2} - V\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial x}) + V^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}(\nu\frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial x^2} - V\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial x}) \nonumber \\
	\frac{\partial^3 \omega}{\partial t^3} &=& \nu^3\frac{\partial^6}{\partial x^6} - 3\nu^2V\frac{\partial^5}{\partial x^5} + 3V^2\nu\frac{\partial^4}{\partial x^4} - V^3\frac{\partial^3}{\partial x^3}
	\label{eqnarray:t3}
\end{eqnarray}

Plugging Equations \ref{eqnarray:t2} and \ref{eqnarray:t3} into Equation \ref{equation:consistency} the
right hand side becomes:

\begin{eqnarray}
	V^2\Delta t \frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial x^2} - (2V\nu\Delta t &-&V^3\frac{\Delta t^2}{6} + V\frac{\Delta x^2}{6})\frac{\partial^3 \omega}{\partial x^3} + (\nu^2\Delta t -V^2\nu\frac{\Delta t^2}{2})\frac{\partial^4 \omega}{\partial x^4} \nonumber \\
	&+& \nu^2V\frac{\Delta t^2}{2}\frac{\partial^5 \omega}{\partial x^5} - \nu^3\frac{\Delta t^2}{6}\frac{\partial^6 \omega}{\partial x^6}
	\label{eqnarray:leading}
\end{eqnarray}

It can be concluded from Equation \ref{eqnarray:leading} that the $2^{nd}$, $4^{th}$, and $6^{th}$ derivatives are dissipation errors
and the $3^{rd}$ and $5^{th}$ derivatives are dispersion errors.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Formulation of explicit FDE based on FTCS }

Explicit FDE is formulated in Method section. Explicit FDE is given in Equation \ref{eqn:FTCS}.

\subsection{Stability of the Solution of the Explicit FDE of Convection Diffusion Equation}
\begin{figure}[H] 
	\centering 
	\includegraphics[max height=8.5cm]{graphs/FTCS/ConvectionDiffusion/sigma05d05.eps}
	\caption{Convection diffusion solution by the explicit FTCS method with $\sigma= 0.5$ and $d=0.5$ at different time steps.}
 	\label{fig:FTCSsigma05d05}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:FTCSsigma05d05} shows the solution of the explicit FTCS
method for Equation \ref{eqn:cde} with $\sigma= 0.5$ and $d=0.5$ at various time steps.
Figure \ref{fig:FTCSsigma05d025} shows the solution of the same explicit FDE but with 
different d value ($d=0.25$) at various time steps. As can be seen from the Figures \ref{fig:FTCSsigma05d05}
and \ref{fig:FTCSsigma05d025}, as time step increases, both curves continue to oscillate with a decrease in their
amplitudes. It can be seen that the solution of the explicit FDE is convergent for $d=0.5$
and $d=0.25$ while keeping $\sigma$ constant and equal to 0.5. Since the stability is a condition
to be satisfied for convergence, it can be understood that both solutions are stable. \\
\indent Figure \ref{fig:FTCSsigma05d075} shows the solution of the explicit FTCS
method for Equation \ref{eqn:cde} with $\sigma= 0.5$ and $d=0.75$ at the initial condition
and $25^{th}$ time step. The curve in the graph has some deterioration at $nt = 25$. Therefore,
the explicit FDE is unstable for $\sigma= 0.5$ and $d=0.75$.

	\caption{Convection diffusion solution by the explicit FTCS method with $\sigma= 0.25$ and $d=0.5$ at different time steps.}
	 \label{fig:FTCSsigma025d05}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:FTCSsigma025d05} and Figure \ref{fig:FTCSsigma075d05} illustrates the solutions of the explicit FTCS
method for Equation \ref{eqn:cde} for $d=0.5$ with different sigma values, $\sigma= 0.25$ and $\sigma=0.75$,
respectively, at various time steps. In both Figure \ref{fig:FTCSsigma025d05}
and \ref{fig:FTCSsigma075d05}, the wave lengths of curves increases and the amplitudes of the waves are reduced
with increasing time steps. Overall, it can be said that the solution of the explicit FDE is convergent, hence stable 
for $d=0.5$ with $\sigma = 0.25$, and $\sigma = 0.75$ since there is no distortion observed.
\vspace{1em}

Figure \ref{fig:FTCSsigma12d05} demonstrates the solution of the explicit FTCS
method for Equation \ref{eqn:cde} with $\sigma= 1.2$ and $d=0.5$ at various time steps. For the curve in the
Figure \ref{fig:FTCSsigma12d05}, the amplitude of the wave increases, and the wave becomes disrupted with
increasing time step. Consequently, the solution of the explicit FDE is unstable for $\sigma=1.2$ and $d=0.5$\\
\indent To conclude this subsection since the explicit FDE of the convection-diffusion equation is stable for some $d$ 
and $\sigma$ values whereas it can be unstable for some other combinations of $d$ and $\sigma$ values, it is conditionally stable.

\subsection{Comparison of convective eqution with FTBS}

	\caption{Convection solution by the explicit FTBS method with $\sigma= 0.25$ at different time steps.}
	 \label{fig:FTBSsigma025d0}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{fig:FTBSsigma025d0}, \ref{fig:FTBSsigma05d0}, \ref{fig:FTBSsigma075d0}, and \ref{fig:FTBSsigma12d0}
demonstrate solutions of convection equation using FTBS with different $\sigma$ values at various time
steps. It can be observed that for $\sigma$ values less than 1.2, the solutions obtained are convergent.
However, for $\sigma = 1.2$, wave curve is distorted and the solution is divergent. Besides, comparing Figures
\ref{fig:FTBSsigma025d0}, \ref{fig:FTBSsigma05d0}, and \ref{fig:FTBSsigma075d0}, it can be seen that the
amplitudes of the wave curves decrease faster, whereas the wave lengths of the curves experience a more rapid
increase for smaller $\sigma$ values.

Figures \ref{fig:FTBSsigma025d05}, \ref{fig:FTBSsigma05d05}, \ref{fig:FTBSsigma075d05}, and \ref{fig:FTBSsigma12d05}
illustrate the solutions of convection diffusion equation using FTBS with various $\sigma$ values at different time
steps while keeping d value constant. As can be seen from these figures, for $\sigma = 1.2$, a convergent solution
is obtained for the convection diffusion equation. Nonetheless, for $\sigma$ values smaller than 1.2, calculations
gave divergent solutions.

while keeping $\sigma$ value constant. When the d value is decreased to 0.25 from 0.5, the solution remains
convergent. Nevertheless, if the d value is increased, such as 0.75, distortion in wave curve is observed and
the solution obtained is divergent. Comparing Figures \ref{fig:FTBSsigma12d05} and \ref{fig:FTBSsigma12d025},
it is observed that the decrease in the amplitude of the waves is more significant for higher d values. In addition,
the wave length increases faster for d = 0.5 compared to the increase in the wave length for d = 0.25.

Overall, if the solutions of the convection-diffusion equation and the convection equation are
compared, it can be denoted that for $\sigma$ values lower than 1.2 the FTBS equation gives convergent
solutions for the convection equation whereas for the convection-diffusion equation the solutions
obtained by FTBS equation is divergent.

 Some of the results this experimentation is given in Figures \ref{fig:Q4_1}, \ref{fig:Q4_2} and \ref{fig:Q4_3}. 
 As a result, it is concluded that given FDE is unconditionally unstable.

\end{figure}

\vspace{1cm}

Implicit FDE derived in Equation \ref{eqn:implicit} is solved for various $\sigma$ and $d$ values. 
It is found that solution converges for every $\sigma$ and $d$ combination. Therefore implicit method 
is unconditionally stable. Figures \ref{fig:b_1}, \ref{fig:b_2} and \ref{fig:b_3} shows some of the solutions. 
As this method is unconditionally stable, a larger timestep can be used for calculations. But it should be noted that the
accuracy of the solution decreases as timestep increases. Because of that, the time step size is still limited if one wants
an accurate solution.

\section{Conclusion}
In this homework, the convection-diffusion equation was solved by using different
finite-difference equations and convection equation was solved with the explicit
FTBS equation. First, in the solution of the convection-diffusion equation,
the explicit FTCS equation was used and it was shown that the solution was
conditionally stable. The reason of is that for some combination of $\sigma$ and $d$ values,
convergent, hence stable solutions were determined whereas solutions were unstable
for other combinations, such as $\sigma =1.2$ and $d=0.5$ or  $\sigma =0.5$ and $d=0.75$.
Then, the explicit FTBC equation was used to solve the convection equation. The results showed
that as the value of $\sigma$ increased up to some value, the solutions were stable and
the shrinkage in the waves of solution curves is less significant. Also, the solution
was distorted and unstable for $\sigma=1.2$. Afterwards, the solution of the convection-diffusion equation was calculated with the explicit FTBS method. It was seen that
with constant d value ($d=0.5$), unstable and disrupted solution curves were observed
for some $\sigma$ values such as 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75. On the other hand, for constant 
$\sigma=1.2$, with increased d value up to some value, the change in the waves of solutions,
which were convergent, became more insignificant. When $d$ were increased to 0.75, a divergent
solution was observed. At the next part of the homework, consistency analysis was made,
and it was determined that Equation \ref{equation:q4} is consistent. However, it was seen that
from the solutions of the Equation \ref{equation:q4} with different $\sigma$ and d values,
it is divergent and unstable. In the last part of the homework, the solution of the convection-diffusion equation was calculated with the BTCS Euler implicit method. All solutions obtained in
Subsection 3.6 were convergent with different $\sigma$ and d values. Therefore, it may be more
reasonable to solve the convection-diffusion equation with the implicit FDE since it provided convergent
solutions in a more large range of $\sigma$ and d values than the explicit FDEs.
